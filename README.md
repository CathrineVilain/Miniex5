# miniex5
So this miniex was the most challenging for me EVER! I found working with classes and objects very difficult and I ended up spending all
my time trying to implement the classes and objects. I might as well say it right away; I failed, I did not make a game of any kind. After
spending an entire day coding, I accomplished basically nothing.

What I have is 4 ellipses moving randomly along the y - axis. My initial idea was that you had to click on the ellipses in order to make 
them dissapear and when you've clicked on all of them the game is won! Hurray... I thought this was simple enough to match my very limited
skillset. But I couldn't have been more wrong. I struggled with everything for hours and hours without really having any victories. But as
I'm writing this at 20 minutes to ten at night, I have to admit defeat. Never have I ever been so frustrated during my coding process. 
I'm literally on the verge of tearing up. 

So for those of you giving feedback on my work. There's not really much to work with, and I'm sorry. 

However. If my program did actually work it would be relevant to talk about what kind of information my "game" provides and does not provide. Relatively simple games are often build around objects that act according to a presribed pattern (speed, size etc). Once you learn the pattern you have mastered the game. An example could be a game with obstacles that move in a certain way. The first couple of times you play the game, you might keep loosing. But once you know how the obstacles move (you figure out the pattern) you know how to counteract the obstacles = you win the game and you can repeat the same pattern over and over again. But then the game becomes boring (in my experience at least). My game would have been built on objects that move at random = there is no pattern to learn = no information. Every move is "secret" there is no way that you could figure out what the program would do next. The game would solely rely on your reflexes/ response time to change in the program. It is a kind of exercise for your mind and reflexes, or at least it would have been.
