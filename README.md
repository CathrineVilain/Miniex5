# miniex5
So this miniex was the most challenging for me EVER! I found working with classes and objects very difficult and I ended up spending all
my time trying to implement the classes and objects. I might as well say it right away; I failed, I did not make a game of any kind. After
spending an entire day coding, I accomplished basically nothing.

What I have is 4 ellipses moving randomly along the y - axis. My initial idea was that you had to click on the ellipses in order to make 
them dissapear and when you've clicked on all of them the game is won! Hurray... I thought this was simple enough to match my very limited
skillset. But I couldn't have been more wrong. I struggled with everything for hours and hours without really having any victories. But as
I'm writing this at 20 minutes to ten at night, I have to admit defeat. Never have I ever been so frustrated during my coding process. 
I'm literally on the verge of tearing up. 

So for those of you giving feedback on my work. There's not really much to work with, and I'm sorry.
